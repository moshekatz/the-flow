# The Flow

The app I built to track my expenses.

If you want to check it out, I recommend to go in the following order:

1. [Sign Up](https://the-flow.vercel.app/) and play with the app (It's free).
2. [Read the blog post](https://moshekatz.dev/projects/the-flow) I wrote about how I built it.
3. Clone the repo and play with the code (you can also go [here](https://github1s.com/moshekatz/the-flow) for an in-browser vscode experience).
